## Academic Integrity Policy:
Although students are encouraged to help their classmates, students sharing code are guilty of plagiarism. If programs are considered too similar, the students will be asked to explain. The Dean will be notified about any such offenses as well as the Academic Code of Conduct Committee. In all cases of cheating, students who supply code or take it will both be penalized. The penalty for all students involved in academic integrity violations is failure in the class. Under no circumstances may sites like chegg.com be used, you may not cite them as a source. UM has a chatgpt tool available for use - https://umgpt.umich.edu/ - you may use it, but must cite it as a source using code comments, including the prompt used. You may not turn in an entire solution from chatgpt, the bulk of your work must be your original effort, just like an English paper, you can’t turn in 1 giant quotation

## Late Projects & Homework: 
Will not be accepted without prior written approval.
